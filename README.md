## 7. Backlog
- The current hour might be a little lagger than the actual hour few minuttes. That's might be becuase of api data fetching needs time to be processing. 
- The app is suitable for desktop full screen only.
- To open the app, the user have to turn on the location.

## P.S. :
- For this project, I did it follow through the "Modern React with Redux [2023 Update]" course of Udemy; mostly in section 5.
- Other majority part of the project like choosing datas to be called to displayed, api id to the package of houly and daily forcasts, using loops and slice in javascript, and other related inquiries, I did research on OpenWeather, on some random sources, and receiving assistances from my friends.
